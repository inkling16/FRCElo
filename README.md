# FRCElo

This workbook describes the Elo ratings of every team in FRC since 2002. Every match since 2002 is used, and the model predictions and results can be found in the year sheets. Detailed information about each team can be found in the "Team Lookup" sheet. To use the "team lookup" sheet, simply enter a team number into cell B1, and optionally a second team into cell B2, and press the "Import Teams" button. The second team will then show up on the same graph as the first team, but with "+" markers. If you only want to view a single team, leave cell B2 blank. Optionally, after importing teams, enter your desired year range into cells B3 and B4 and press the "Update Range" button. Team Elo ratings at the end of each season can be found in the "End of Season Elos" sheet. Average team Elo ratings for each season can be found in the "Average Elos" sheet. Max team Elo ratings can be found in the "Max Elos" sheet. Elos for every team at every event can be found in the "All Event Elos" sheet.
